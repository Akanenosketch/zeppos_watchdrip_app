 # zeppos Watchdrip Companion App for ZEPP OS (Blood sugar monitor) 

This repository contains a ZEPP OS watch app which is designed to work together with <a href="https://github.com/bigdigital/zeppos_watchdrip_timer_wf">watchface</a>
and Android phone Watchdrip application (see the latest version on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xdrip_miband">Patreon page</a>). 
The app is proving side app API for the watchface, so the watchface could directly fetch data from the Android App.
As a additional option this app also can directly display the fetched data.
